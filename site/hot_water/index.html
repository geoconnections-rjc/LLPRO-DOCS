<p>Use this page to create a new hot water generation zone within the selected Zone Group. An unlimited number of hot water zones are allowed. Water-water heat pumps (as well as non-reversible water source units) are viable options for hot water generation when required temperatures are below 120°F, although some may be able to reach hot water delivery temperatures up to 140°F. Consult with the manufacturer for more information.</p>
<h2 id="hot-water-zone-name">HOT WATER ZONE NAME</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - Name the hot water zone currently being designed. An unlimited number of hot water zones are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="peak-block-hot-water-generation">PEAK BLOCK HOT WATER GENERATION</h2>
<hr />
<p>Enter the hot water demand rates for each time block increment. <strong>The most critical values will be the maximum hot water generation loads placed in the time block in which they occur.</strong>  Accuracy is not as critical for the loads in off-peak time blocks as they will simply be used to calculate the system part-load factor. The recommended entries in the off-peak time blocks will be the <strong>AVERAGE</strong> hot water demand rates in each respective time period.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="background:#FEF1E1; margin:1px;">&nbsp;HEATING MODE HOT WATER DEMAND ENTRY&nbsp;</span></strong> - Enter hot water loads in the <span style="background:#FEF1E1; margin:1px;">&nbsp;HEATING COLUMN&nbsp;</span> to account for added peak heating demand and annual ground loads due to concurrent operation of the hot water generation and space conditioning (heating) system.<ul>
<li>Doing so will increase heating GHEX design lengths for heating dominant applications.</li>
<li>From a design standpoint, it is most conservative to give the hot water generation system full benefit when heating is the critical load requirement. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span style="background:#DFE8F1; margin:1px;">&nbsp;COOLING MODE HOT WATER DEMAND ENTRY&nbsp;</span></strong> - Enter hot water loads in the <span style="background:#DFE8F1; margin:1px;">&nbsp;COOLING COLUMN&nbsp;</span> to account for reduced peak cooling demand and annual ground loads due to concurrent operation of the hot water generation and space conditioning (cooling) system.<ul>
<li>Doing so will decrease cooling GHEX design lengths for cooling dominant applications.</li>
<li>From a design standpoint, it is most conservative to give the hot water generation system zero benefit when cooling is the critical load requirement. </li>
</ul>
