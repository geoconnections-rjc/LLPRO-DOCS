<li><span class="term">Year</span> The analysis period to use in the GHEX model. <strong>LoopLink PRO</strong> will use this value to predict the temperature change of the soil resulting from imbalances between the amount of heat added to the ground in cooling mode and removed from the ground in heating mode. Values from 10-20 years are most common.<ul>
<li>The recommended value for this field is 10 years.
<li class="warning"><h3>WARNING</h3><p>Use of excessive values in this field will result in extremely conservative estimates for the Year-N temperature penalty, thus increasing overall design lengths and system first cost.

<h2 id="formation-details">Formation Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">Deep Earth Temperature</span> The temperature of the soil, which can be assumed to be constant starting at a depth of 20 feet below the surface down to about 200 feet below the surface.<ul>
<li>Deep earth temperature varies with location and weather conditions but is typically assumed to be 1-2 degrees above the average air temperature for the project location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Formation Thermal Conductivity</span> The thermal conductivity of the native soil at the project location, which is a measure of how fast heat moves through a material due to a temperature difference.<ul>
<li>Formation thermal conductivity is dependent on soil or rock type, moisture content, and density.</li>
<li>For large systems (&gt;25 tons), a formation thermal conductivity test (FTC test, in-situ test) is recommended to directly measure soil properties.</li>
<li>For smaller systems, soil properties may be estimated if knowledge of local soil conditions is available.</li>
<li>For detailed soil information by state and county, visit the <a href="http://soils.usda.gov/survey/printed_surveys" title="USDA Web Soil Survey">USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service website</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term">Formation Thermal Diffusivity</span> The thermal diffusivity of the native soil. Soil diffusivity is dependent on soil type, moisture content, and density.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal diffusivity is a measure of how fast heat moves relative to its heat storage capacity.</li>
<li>If a FTC test has not been performed, a good first estimate of formation thermal diffusivity is assuming it to be approximately 70% of the formation thermal conductivity value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The temperature of the soil in the top 20 ft. of the earth's surface varies with location, time of year, and depth.  Mean Soil Temperature, Annual Swing, and Offset Day are necessary inputs to predict the soil temperature at a given location, time of year, and length using the Kusudah-Achenbach equation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the figure below to see how soil temperature in Chicago, IL varies with depth and time of year (according to the Kusudah-Achenbach model).</li>
<li><img alt="Soil Temperature vs. Depth &amp; Time of Year in Chicago, IL" src="../img/chicago_il_air_soil_temps.gif" title="Soil Temperature vs. Depth &amp; Time of Year in Chicago, IL" /></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="term">Mean Soil Temperature</span> The mean earth temperature in top 10 feet of soil at a given location.</p>
<ul>
<li>This value will be similar to the average annual air temperature at the given location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Annual Swing</span> The earth surface temperature annual swing above and below the mean soil temperature at a given location.<ul>
<li>This value typically ranges from 10-20 in moderate climates and from 30-40 in extreme climates with large swings in air temperature from summer to winter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Offset Day</span> The number of days after January 1 to the minimum earth surface temperature.<ul>
<li>The minimum soil surface temperature typically occurs in 30-40 days from the start of the year.</li>

<h2 id="borehole-definition">Borehole Definition</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">Bore Diameter</span> The diameter of the borehole being drilled for insertion of the GHEX piping.<ul>
<li>Common borehole diameters range from 4&quot;-6&quot;, depending on drilling conditions and the size of the u-bend piping being utilized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Piping Material</span> The piping material used in the active portion of the vertical GHEX.<ul>
<li>HDPE and PEXa are the only piping materials formally accepted by the <a href="http://www.geoconnectionsinc.com/bookstore/IGSHPA_design_installation_standards.html" title="Geo-Connections Bookstore">IGSHPA Standards Committee</a> for use in the buried portion of a GHEX piping system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Dimension Ratio (DR)</span> The ratio of loop pipe outside diameter to its wall thickness.<ul>
<li>Greater wall thickness (resulting in higher pipe pressure ratings) are associated with lower values of DR.</li>
<li>DR-11 HDPE (3408/3608) is the most commonly used u-bend piping, which has a 160 psi pressure rating at 73.4&deg;F.</li>
<li>DR-9 HDPE (3408/3608) has a 200 psi pressure rating at 73.4&deg;F.</li>
<li>Pertinent properties of Outside Diameter (OD), Inside Diameter (ID) and Pressure Rating (psi, according to AWWA C901/C906) are displayed once a pipe selection has been made.  </li>
<li>Refer to Table A.1 in Chapter 3 of the <a href="http://plasticpipe.org/publications/pe_handbook.html" title="Plastic Pipe Institute">Second Edition Handbook of PE Pipe</a> for more information on HDPE pipe pressure ratings.</li>

<p><span class="term">Nominal Size</span> The u-bend pipe diameter to be used in the active section of the horizontally-bored GHEX.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LoopLink PRO</strong> will account for film resistance (a function of Reynold's number, which is determined by calculating gpm per loop, circulating fluid type, temperature and antifreeze concentration).</li>
<li>Design the GHEX to stay within the provided flow ranges (per parallel loop) in order to guarantee that parallel loop flow will be:<ol>
<li>Low enough to operate below the maximum recommended flow rate for head loss, which is  4 ft. H2O (per 100 ft.).</li>
<li>High enough to operate with turbulent internal pipe flow through the parallel loop, which corresponds to a Reynold's number greater than 2,500.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Simply adjust the number of bores / parallel flow paths in the GHEX if the flow rate in each loop is above or below the optimum range.</li>

<h2 id="circulating-fluid">Circulating Fluid</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">Circulating Fluid Selection</span> Specify the fluid type and antifreeze concentration to be used (if applicable).<ul>
<li>In general, freeze protection is recommended when heating mode EWTs will fall below 45&deg;F (7.2&deg;C).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Antifreeze Concentration Slider</span> When the selected circulating fluid type is propylene glycol, methanol or ethanol, the antifreeze concentration vs. freeze point temperature slider will appear. Choose the appropriate concentration based on the specified antifreeze type.<ul>
<li>The recommended freeze point will be 10&deg;F below the average loop temperature under peak heating conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loopfield-layout">Loopfield Layout</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="term">Rows</span> The number of rows to be used in the horizontally-bored GHEX layout.<ul>
<li>For example, a 10x2 loopfield layout would have 10 rows with 2 bores in each row for a total of 20 bores (rows x bores per row).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Bores per Row</span> The number of bores in each row to be used in the horizontally-bored GHEX layout.<ul>
<li>The allowed range of values for Bores per Row is 1-3.</li>
<li>For example, a 10x2 loopfield layout would have 10 rows with 2 bores in each row for a total of 20 bores (rows x bores per row).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">CC Spacing Row</span> The center-center spacing between rows. This value will affect the predicted temperature change of the soil resulting from imbalances between the amount of heat added to the ground in cooling mode and removed from the ground in heating mode.<ul>
<li><strong>For systems with severe imbalances, values less than 20 ft. are not recommended</strong>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Cc Spacing Bore</span> The center-center spacing between bores in a given row. You may specify a separate value in this field when the Cc Spacing Row and Cc Spacing Bore fields are un-linked.<ul>
<li><strong>For systems with severe imbalances, values less than 20 ft. are not recommended</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Start Depth</span> The target depth of the shallowest bore in a row.<ul>
<li>For example, if horizontal bores are to be installed at depths of 15, 30, and 45 ft. below grade in each row, the start depth for this field would be 15 ft.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Drilling Offset</span> The amount of horizontal offset between bores in the same row.<ul>
<li>For ease of installation, it is common for the drilling contractor to move over for each subsequent bore in a row rather than to stack all of the bores directly on top of one another.</li>
<li>A good value for drilling offset is <strong>Cc Spacing Row / Bores per Row</strong>.</li>
<li>For example, assuming a 15 ft. Cc Spacing Row and 3 Bores per Row, a typical offset value would be 15/3 = 5 ft. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Angle of Approach</span> The angle at which the contractor will drill into the soil from the surface until the target depth is achieved.<ul>
<li><strong>LoopLink PRO</strong> will account for the portion of the loop that is installed above target depth. The most commonly used values are provided as selection choices.</li>
<li>For example, if a bore is installed 45 ft. below grade and the drilling entry angle is specified to be 3:1 (18.4 degrees), it will take a 135 ft. run for the drilling length to reach the target depth.</li>

<li class="warning"><h3>WARNING</h3><p>Use of excessive values in the <strong>Year</strong> field will result in extremely conservative estimates for the Year-N temperature penalty, thus increasing overall design lengths and system first cost. Keep in mind that this calculation assumes (1) the building load and annual equivalent FLRHs for the Zone Group are accurate without large margin of error and/or safety factor and (2) the building will be used in exactly the same manner every year for N-Years.</p></li> </li>

<li>The occurrence of turbulent flow will maximize heat transfer between the circulating fluid and internal pipe wall (commonly referred to as film resistance).</li>
<li>In practice, a Reynold's number greater than 2,500 is considered to correspond to turbulent flow.</li>
<li>Reynold's number is a function of the individual loop <strong>Velocity</strong> as well as the circulating fluid type, temperature and antifreeze concentration. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="term">Head Loss/100 (ft)</span> The calculated pressure drop (ft. of head loss per 100 ft. of pipe length) through the ground loop piping, which is a function of the individual loop <strong>Velocity</strong>, pipe surface roughness and the circulating fluid type, temperature and antifreeze concentration.<ul>
<li>In general, values for head loss between 1-3 ft. H20 (per 100 ft.) are considered optimal.</li>
<li>The maximum recommended value is 4 ft. H20 (per 100 ft).</li>
<li>When loop head loss exceeds 4 ft. H2O (per 100 ft.), either increase the loop pipe size or add bores (to reduce parallel loop flow) in order to reduce head loss. </li>
